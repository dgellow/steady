# Test Data

This directory should contain:

1. **datadog-openapi.json** - The Datadog OpenAPI specification (8.4MB)
   - Download from:
     https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-api-spec/blob/main/spec/datadog-v2.json
   - Or use your existing copy

2. **simple-test.json** - A simple test schema (created by the consistency test
   script)

The test scripts expect these files to be in this directory. The simple test
file will be created automatically when you run the consistency test.
